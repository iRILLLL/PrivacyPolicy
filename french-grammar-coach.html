        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

        <p><strong>French Grammar Coach</strong> ("the App") is developed by iril. This Privacy Policy explains how we
            handle your information when you use the App.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>Data stored locally on your device:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quiz answers and progress</li>
            <li>Reading and listening exercise progress</li>
            <li>Study streak and statistics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is stored only on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

        <h2>Analytics</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any analytics or usage data. The App does not track your activity or behavior.</p>

        <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>The App offers optional auto-renewable subscriptions processed entirely by Apple through the App Store.
            Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
            We do not collect or store any payment information.</p>

        <h2>AI-Powered Features</h2>
        <p>The App offers optional AI-powered features including Grammar Checker, Writing Tools, AI Explain, and Chat
            with AI. When you use these features, the text you enter is sent to Google's Gemini API via our Cloudflare
            Workers servers for processing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not store the text you submit or the responses generated.</li>
            <li>Requests are processed in real time and are not retained on our servers.</li>
            <li>Google may process your data in accordance with their <a
                    href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App may connect to third-party services for audio content delivery and AI processing (e.g., Cloudflare,
            Google). These services may collect standard server logs (IP address, request timestamps) as part of normal
            operation.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties. Your quiz progress and study data
            remain on your device.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>All user-generated data (progress, statistics) is stored locally on your device. You can delete this data at
            any time through the App's settings by clearing your progress.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is rated 4+ and is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
            children. Since all data is stored locally, no personally identifiable information is collected from any
            user.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an
            updated revision date.</p>
